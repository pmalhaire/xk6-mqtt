# xk6-mqtt

This is a [k6](https://go.k6.io/k6) extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This is a proof of concept, isn't supported by the k6 team, and may break in the future. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

This project is a k6 extension that can be used to load test Mqtt.
Per each connection to Mqtt, many messages can be sent. These messages are an array of strings.
There is also a consumer for testing purposes, i.e. to make sure you send the correct data to Mqtt.
The consumer is not meant to be used for testing Mqtt under load.

## k6 version

This extension is tested with k6 version `v0.43.1` last release is [v0.39.2](https://github.com/pmalhaire/xk6-mqtt/releases/tag/v0.39.2).


## Build & Run

If you want to contribute and improve this extension (you are welcome !) see Build for development section.

If your are only interrested to use this extension and write your own js tests this section is for you.
It only requieres docker.

Run the following commands.

```bash
# 1. Create path for k6 (here my_k6_path)
mkdir my_k6_path
# 2. Build the k6 binary including the extension in the current path with
docker run --rm -it -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" grafana/xk6 build v0.43.1 --with github.com/pmalhaire/xk6-mqtt@v0.39.2
# 3. Run a sample mqtt server
docker run --rm --name mosquitto -d -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf
# 4. Get a test sample test.js file
wget -O test.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmalhaire/xk6-mqtt/main/examples/test.js
# 5. Run the test for 10s
./k6 run --vus 50 --duration 10s test.js
```

Your extension is working.

You are ready to customize
- replace the `mqtt server` you want to test (step 3)
- write the specifics things you want to test in your `my_test.js` file (step 4)

```bash
./k6 run --vus 50 --duration 10s test.js

## Build for development

If you need to edit the code of this extension.

You should have the latest version of Go (go1.20) installed.
I recommend you to have [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) installed.

To build a `k6` binary with this extension, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Then, install [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) and build your custom k6 binary with the Mqtt extension:

1. Install `xk6`:
  ```shell
  $ go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

    Build the binary: from source code
  ```shell
  git clone github.com/pmalhaire/xk6-mqtt
  cd xk6-mqtt
  $ xk6 build --with github.com/pmalhaire/xk6-mqtt=.
  ```

## Run & Test

First, you need to have your Mqtt development environment setup.

For example you can use vernemq

```
docker run --rm -p 1883:1883 -e "DOCKER_VERNEMQ_ACCEPT_EULA=yes" -e DOCKER_VERNEMQ_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=on --name vernemq -d vernemq/vernemq
```

or Mosquitto

```
docker run --rm --name mosquitto -d -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf
```

optional use tls see: https://openest.io/en/services/mqtts-how-to-use-mqtt-with-tls/

```
docker run -v $PWD/docker_conf/mosquitto:/conf --rm --name mosquitto -p 8883:8883 eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto -c /conf/mosquitto-tls.conf
```

### k6 Test

To use this extension write you test as a js file :

The sample [test file](examples/test.js) does the following.

Creates per VU (concurrent clients) :
- one topic
- one subscribe connection
- one publish connection

Per iteration :
- Subscribe to topic
- Publish to topic `messageCount` messages
- Read and check message `messageCount` results

You can run the test using the following command:

```bash
# from previously built version
./k6 run --vus 50 --duration 1m examples/test.js
# from source (you need to be in this repo folder) directly for debug
xk6 run --vus 50 --duration 1m examples/test.js
```

Sample test result output:

```bash

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  |
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: examples/test.js
     output: -

  scenarios: (100.00%) 1 scenario, 50 max VUs, 1m30s max duration (incl. graceful stop):

### optional test influx

```
docker run --rm --name mosquitto -d -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf
docker run --rm --name influx -d -p 8086:8086 influxdb:1.8-alpine
K6_OUT=influxdb=localhost:8086 xk6 run --vus 50 --duration 1m examples/test.js
```

## ROADMAP

- Add examples with events for async functions (k6/events)
- Make subscribe function async
- Update the code to allow multiple event listener or at least clean the singleton
- Allow multiple subscribe calls
- Test https://github.com/goiiot/libmqtt as an alternate client (pprof shows bottleneck in paho client)
- Investigate performance there are string copy made in sync publish function that should not be done
